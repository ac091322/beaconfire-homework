    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

    <hr />

    <h3>Will show list of songs fetched from the database here:</h3>
    <div id="song-list"></div>
    <br />

    <hr />

    <p>You're welcome to use my seeders to seed data for the users, artists, songs, likes, and followings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users: node ./seeders/seedUsers.js</li>
        <li>Users: node ./seeders/seedArtists.js</li>
        <li>Users: node ./seeders/seedSongs.js</li>
        <li>Users: node ./seeders/seedLikes.js</li>
        <li>Users: node ./seeders/seedFollows.js</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>I'm not able to complete the frontend because I ran out of time. I'm only fetching the songs to show a connection
        between the backend and the frontend.</p>

    <p>However, the backend is fully completed. The following are the main backend routes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get all users</li>
        <li>Get user by ID</li>
        <li>Create new user</li>
        <li>Update username, email, password</li>
        <li>Get artist by ID</li>
        <li>Create artist</li>
        <li>Delete artist</li>
        <li>Get likes of a user</li>
        <li>Get all songs</li>
        <li>Get song by ID</li>
        <li>Query for songs by title, album, genre, language, and artist</li>
        <li>Like a song</li>
        <li>Unlike a song</li>
        <li>Get followings of a user</li>
        <li>Follow an artist</li>
        <li>Unfollow an artist</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are screenshots along with the postman test collection and enviroment files in the "postman" folder.</p>

    <p>Problem 1 only uses the Atlas cluster, while Problem is setup to use the local MongoDB in development and the
        Atlas cluster in production. The ".env" file is included, but my password is removed. The database name is still
        there though.</p>
